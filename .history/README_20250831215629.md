# Transformers and Hugging Face: Positional Encoding Demo

Welcome to the **Transformers-and-Hugging-face** repository! 🚀

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Positionaling_Encoding.ipynb`) that demonstrates the concept of **Positional Encoding**—a key technique used in Transformer models for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## What is Positional Encoding?

Transformers are powerful models, but they don't inherently understand the order of words in a sequence. Positional Encoding solves this by injecting information about the position of each token, allowing the model to capture sequence order and context.

## What's Inside?

- 📒 **Positionaling_Encoding.ipynb**: Step-by-step code and explanations for implementing and visualizing positional encodings.
- 🧠 Intuitive visualizations to help you understand how positional encodings work.
- 💡 Simple, clean code—easy to follow and modify for your own experiments.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/angad2803/Transformers-and-Hugging-face.git
   ```
2. Open `Positionaling_Encoding.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells and explore!

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- (Optional) Libraries: numpy, matplotlib

## Why is this cool?

- 🔥 Learn the magic behind Transformers
- 🎨 Visualize how models "see" word positions
- 🛠️ Ready to extend for your own NLP projects
